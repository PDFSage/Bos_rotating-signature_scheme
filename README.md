# I"m well aware I'm using powerful powerful powerful AI, 4 years after this guy probably wrote it manually, but the only thing that we got "compared to evenly" was the existsence of teh sharmir split.

CNSA 2.0 was set by NSA and already includes algorithms like Ed25519, Falcon, and ML-DSA but doesn’t officially adopt FROST. So, no, Bo’s algorithm hasn’t "won" yet.

# After that, I had keygen True, Share Transprot Encrypted True, Secure elemenet abstract True, Commit Phase True, Aggregator Ture, Verification True

And json_io is not a desirable thing; mine auto logs in removes the need for PW ever. I just need to check for NSA compatible and I think it is.

# So this is fully compatible with NSA's hardware, and my name is not in the source code at all; only README

# This is literally in every way what happens when my TPM get compromised. If you're not willing to at least consider the truth, then take the open source because I do not want to talk to you and obviously don't have any incentive to.
