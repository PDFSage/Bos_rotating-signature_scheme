**Plain-English, side-by-side overview (same n-of-t cluster of nodes)**

| Question                                 | **Bo’s Standard (rotate-&-sign)**                                                                                                                    | **Sharded Diffie–Hellman (split-&-handshake)**                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **What happens when you log in?**        | Cluster collects t active shares, rebuilds—or threshold-creates—a **digital signature** with the current RSA key. Server just checks that signature. | Cluster collects t active shares, derives a **shared secret** and finishes a Diffie-Hellman handshake with the server. No signature left behind. |
| **Does the server have to change much?** | Almost nothing: if it can verify an RSA signature it’s ready.                                                                                        | Needs to speak the custom DH-handshake or PSK flow, so code changes are required.                                                                |
| **Audit trail / proof you logged in**    | Yes. The signature is a permanent, verifiable record that “the quorum logged in at 14:03”.                                                           | No built-in record; once the session key is gone you can’t later prove who logged in.                                                            |
| **Forward secrecy**                      | Comes from **key rotation** (new RSA pair v → v+1 on a schedule).                                                                                    | Built-in: every handshake can use fresh DH nonces—no rotation needed.                                                                            |
| **Performance per login**                | One big-integer RSA signature plus some quorum coordination. Heavy but only once per session.                                                        | A few elliptic-curve multiplies for each node every session. Lightweight but constant.                                                           |
| **Complexity inside each node**          | Must support X25519, AES-GCM, Shamir math **and** big-integer RSA (or threshold-RSA protocol).                                                       | Only needs elliptic-curve math and Shamir. Simpler codebase, easier to fit on constrained devices.                                               |
| **Side-channel & implementation risk**   | RSA is larger-surface; many mitigations needed.                                                                                                      | Curve operations are smaller, generally easier to harden.                                                                                        |
| **Fits heterogeneous hardware?**         | Works, but every device must speak all those primitives; slowest/weakest may bottleneck.                                                             | Easier: most secure elements already support one of the standard curves.                                                                         |
| **Human passwords needed?**              | None—quorum produces signature automatically.                                                                                                        | Same—quorum derives handshake key automatically.                                                                                                 |
| **Bottom-line feel**                     | Best when you need backward-compatible servers and a signed receipt of every login. Heavier and more layered.                                        | Best when you want lean, always-forward-secret sessions and can upgrade the server side. Lighter but no built-in audit trail.                    |

**In one sentence:**
*Bo’s rotating-signature scheme is like handing the door guard a stamped, time-coded ticket; the sharded Diffie scheme is like quietly agreeing on a secret knock—both open the door without a password, but the ticket leaves a receipt while the knock stays ephemeral.*
