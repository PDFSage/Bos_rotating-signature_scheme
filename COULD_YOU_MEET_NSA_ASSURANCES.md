The threshold modular system has several advantages: itâ€™s simpler and more flexible than NSA's KMI, utilizes threshold authentication to mitigate insider threats, allows quick participant key rotations, and supports algorithm agility. However, it comes with drawbacks: it uses unapproved algorithms like Curve25519, lacks post-quantum cryptography, and is vulnerable to hardware exfiltration. Additionally, the lack of FIPS certification, limited auditing capabilities, and the risk of metadata leakage from Shamir secret sharing pose challenges. Performance-wise, Ed25519 offers speed, but regulatory compliance is crucial, especially for classified data.
